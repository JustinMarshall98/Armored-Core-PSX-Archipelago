# Armored Core

## What does randomization do to this game?

Most randomization features for this apworld are still in development.
Currently the apworld handles Missions randomization.

## What is the goal of Armored Core when randomized?

In Progressive Missions mode, complete Destroy Floating Mines.
In Mission-Sanity mode, complete a number of missions you can set between 1 and 46.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Each mission completed is a location where you can find a check.
In Progressive Missions mode there are 9 progressive mission items that each unlock a set of missions in roughly the order they appear in the original game.
In Mission-Sanity mode each mission also has its own check, so you can be sent missions in any order as they are found by you and other players.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Missions and Progressive Missions depending on how you are playing, as well as filler (Credits, Human+ Levels, etc).

## What does another world's item look like in Armored Core?

You item acquisitions take the form of having completed a mission or reading mail.
As such you'll have to check the BizHawk client to know the actual items that are unlocked from these locations.
Note that mission completion isn't checked until you have re-entered the Raven's Nest menu.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

In the Raven's Nest menu the client will update the Mission list with what you have access to. If you are currently in the Mission list when sent a mission, you have to exit and re-enter for it to update.
